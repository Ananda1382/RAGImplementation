Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for Car Purchase Suggestions
Overview
This project implements a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) model using OpenAI's text embedding and chat completion capabilities. The goal is to provide car purchase recommendations based on a given query, utilizing an embedding-based search mechanism for retrieving relevant context.

Features
Utilizes OpenAI's text-embedding-3-small model to generate vector representations of car listings.

Computes similarity between user queries and stored embeddings using the dot product.

Retrieves the top 5 most relevant listings based on similarity scores.

Generates responses using OpenAI's gpt-3.5-turbo, incorporating retrieved context.

Outputs the response as a poem, focusing on German or Japanese car models.

Installation & Setup
Prerequisites
Python 3.x

OpenAI Python client

Pandas

NumPy

Installation
Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/sathyaseelancr/RAGImplementation.git
cd your-repo-name
Install dependencies:

pip install openai pandas numpy
Place the car listing dataset (CarListing_2023Septemberdata_1.csv) in the ExternalData directory.

Usage
1. Initial Data Processing
The script processes the car listing dataset to generate embeddings, which are then stored in both CSV and pickle (.pkl) formats to optimize performance.

Run the following command to execute the script:

python your_script.py
2. Querying for Car Suggestions
To get car purchase recommendations, modify the script or integrate it into an application that calls:

suggestion_to_buy_a_car("I want to buy a car in December. Help me choose one under $30,000.")

Technical Explanation
The get_embedding function retrieves the numerical representation of a text input.

The embeddings for car listings are precomputed and stored to avoid redundant API calls.

The dot product is used to find the most relevant car listings based on user queries.

The suggestion_to_buy_a_car function fetches relevant listings and formulates a response using OpenAI's GPT model.

Performance Optimizations
Pickle Format: The dataset is stored in .pkl format for faster loading and reduced parsing overhead.

Precomputed Embeddings: Avoids redundant API calls and reduces costs.

Future Enhancements
Support for additional filters like fuel type, mileage, and location.

Integration with a front-end application for user interaction.

Caching and indexing to improve retrieval speed.
